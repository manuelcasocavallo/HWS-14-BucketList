### Hacking with SwiftUI - Project 14

BucketList is part of the Hacking with SwiftUI course by Paul Hudson. 

It's a SwiftUI app that uses MapKit to fetch the user's location and makes a call to the Wikipedia API to show relevant nearby places. 
The user can also place a MKPointAnnotation on the map and see the relevant places near the annotation. 

The app is protected with TouchID/FaceID.
